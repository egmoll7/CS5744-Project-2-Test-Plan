        </div>

        <div class="row mt-3">
            <p>Our integration plan and requirements for testing will be based on the access and usability
                between the different types of users. The application should have certain functions that not
                all users can access. It should also have the ability for users to make notes that Veterinarians
                can view, and no other user can edit the Veterinarians notes, but the individual Veterinarian.
                The application will allow many different types of users to interact with a database, each
                authorized user has their own level of access restrictions.
            </p>

            <p>We believe that the best Plan Build and Test Plan for this system will be a Boehmâ€™s Spiral Model.
                The testing should be integrated at each prototype because the application is dealing with sensitive
                information that needs to be securely validated. The system is intended to be used where it is not
                essential for all of the intended end users to have access to all of the program operations and
                information.
                The system can be built for one set of users at a time. This will give the building team time to build
                the
                application for the Veterinarian user that does not have any restrictions. Then to create additional
                user
                restrictions as each prototype is developed.
            </p>

            <p>This will ensure that the most important type of users have access to the full performance of the
                application.
                Performing this type of testing, the builders can ensure that they are testing the different users level
                access,
                from the most important, Veterinarians, to the last phase of users, like Groomers and Travel Agencies.
                Which is
                why we believe that the Spiral Model of testing is the best for this application. Each phase will allow
                for the
                builders to ensure that the application is meeting the objectives of the phases intended clients,
                addressing one
                clients risks at a time and developing one clients platform at a time.

            <p>The Test Procedure for this application is going to consist of 4 prototypes: building team will build the
                prototypes for each specific type of user, gather information of the users interaction and performance
                and
                business integration. The users will be tested in isolation to ensure they have the correct interaction
                with

                integrity risks. The test will be focus on User Interactions and Reusability.
