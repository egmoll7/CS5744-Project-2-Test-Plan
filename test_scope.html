        <div class="row mt-3">
            <p>For a better understanding of the application, we decided to develop the Test Plan first with the purpose
                of limiting our scope to the components of the system shown in Figure 1. To implement our test cases we
                have included the requirements determined by the Design Team. The goal is to ensure that each module of
                the system’s functionality is covered by one of our four prototypes within the restrictions set by our
                Test Plan. The plan will focus on the integration, validation and performance of the system as a whole.

            <h4>Functional Requirements</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="row mt-3">
            <p>While the current Functional Requirements are only set in the first three prototypes, we anticipate that
                the fourth and final prototype will then include all of the same functions, but with less access to
                Groomers and Travel Agencies user types.

                of application performance and user types interactions. We have included a fourth column to identify the
