            <p>The application is going to be validated against the requirements that were included in our test plan.
                The goal of the validation testing is to ensure that the application actually meets the userâ€™s needs and
                satisfy the specified business requirements. In other words, this process will validate that the
                application is user ready for a production deployment. The validation testing is going to be broken into
                five functional areas outlined in the table below, we also included a new column to identify the user
                type that meets the individual requirements for that function in specific.

            <p>We believe that the best Validation Tests for this system will be using the Black Box Testing Concept.
                This type of testing will allow us to test the behavior of the application for the desired functionality
                without focusing on the actual software internal structure. The test cases will be based on the analysis
                of the specifications, functional and non-functional requirements set by the Design Team. The desired
                outcome of this testing is to make sure that the end users will be able to use the application without
                issues and identify possible issues that user may encounter to fix them on time.
